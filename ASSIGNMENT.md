# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
 I learned by reading through the readme file and then trying to run some examples of my own. the Function names are clear. However calling the param opt (options) is confusing because in most cases he is passing multiple prompts with options. To fix this it should be called prompts.


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
Good comments describe what a method or piece of code does without explicitly explaining how it is done.


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
2


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
No


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
I originally had JSDoc 2.4 installed which caused errors when trying to use it with a node module. these issues were resolved when i switched over to version 3.
